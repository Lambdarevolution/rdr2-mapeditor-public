Im painstakingly rewriting most of the files of the editor. The original editor was internally a complete mess and was never intended to be released as-is. Since it was mostly for testing alot of the code was just piled on without any thought of maintainability or consistency.

Rewriting the entire project is a slow process so commits might be anything from weeks to months apart.
